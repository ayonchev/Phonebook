# Phonebook

## Overview
A simple phonebook mobile application, that I created for the 'Programming mobile applications' course in my university with *Xamarin.Forms*. The application supports adding, editing, deleting and viewing contacts, as well as searching for them by name. A contact has *id*, *name*, *phone number*, *description*, *picture* and a *category* properties. The app stores the contacts in a SQLite database on the target device. The app also supports adding a picture of the contact from the local pictures of the smartphone.
